# Tuples are a type of data structure that can store different values (similar to lists)
# used in special situations

coordinates = [(4, 5), (6, 7), (80, 34)] # tuples are immutable (cannot be changed and modified)
                     # tuples are parantheses, lists are brackets (which can be changed)
print(coordinates[0])
